The parcel section  of the Head Post Oﬃce is in a mess. The parcels that need to be loaded to the vans have been lined up in a row in an arbitr order of weights. The Head Post Master wants them to be sorted in the increasing
order of the weights of the parcels, with one exception. wants the heaviest
(and presumably the most valuable) parcel kept nearest his oﬃce.
You and your friend try to sort these boxes and you decide to sort them by
interchanging two boxes at a time. Such an interchange needs eff equals to the product of the weights of the twoboxes. The objective is to reposition the boxes as required with minimum effort.
