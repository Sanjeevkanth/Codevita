You are provided with two sequences with N,M strings in each. Your task is very simple, you need to match the strings in N with that of M and generate a series of strings. Given any number P you need to figure out the combination that is matched.
Example: {q,w,e,r,t,y} and {a,s,d} are the sequences you are given. In this case N=6 and M=3. The solution for 1-10 as P is shown:
1 - qa
2 - ws
3 - ed
4 - ra
5 - ts
6 - yd
7 - qa
8 - ws
9 - ed
10 -ra
