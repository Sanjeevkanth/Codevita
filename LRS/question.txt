Given a string, find the length of the longest repeating subsequence such that the two subsequences don’t have the same string character at the same position, i.e., any i’th character in the two subsequences shouldn’t have the same index in the original string.
For example:
String: TETEARRVZV
The longest subsequence that repeats itsel is TERV, length of which is 4.


Sample Input
TETEARRVZV

Sample Output
4
