Paul was typing a mail to his boss. Unfortunately the keyboard in his laptop is malfunctioning, therefore whenever he types a word, some of the characters are reapeated. In order to rectify this problem he parses the text to an AI for spell check. The AI processes this text and gives the output. However, Paul is not that confident and hence wants you to check the output. You devise a method, if all the characters generated by the AI are present in the text parsed atleast for the same number of times then the AI has done a fairly good job. Print "YES" if its a good job else print "NO".
