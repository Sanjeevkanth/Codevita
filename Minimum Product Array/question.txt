The task is to find the minimum sum of Products of two arrays of the same size, given that k modifications are allowed on the first array. In each modification, one array element of the first array can either be increased or decreased by 2.
Note- the product sum is Summation (A[i]*B[i]) for all i from 1 to n where n is the size of both arrays
