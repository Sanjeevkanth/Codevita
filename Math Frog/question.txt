The Math Frog lives In the Geometry Pond along with its mate. The Geometry Pond is a marshy piece of water with many mounds in it, , separated by stretches of water. The pond may be approximated by a square grid, with each grid square
being either a mound or water.
It being Sunday, the Math Frog would like to rest from its work of capturing
flies and spend it with its mate, which is on a known square. The Math frog is
able to jump only horizontally or vertically. It can jump over any sheet of
water but it will not jump over a mound. Hence, it can only jump from one mound to a horizontally or vertically adjacent mound (possibly separated by water) in one jump. Note that even when two adjacent squares are mounds, a jump must be made to go from one to the other. The mounds are shown as a n x n matrix with 1 showing a mound, and 0, water. For example, the following pond will be represented by the matrix given below,


Please help the frog jump from its current position to the position of its mate in a minimum number of jumps. You may assume that it is always possible to reach its mate.
