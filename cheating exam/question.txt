You know Galois is a very smart student. He dislikes History exams and you know
that he will find a smart way to cheat. You are the supervisor in the exam hall
for his History exam and you recover from him a sheet of paper that contains
several lines that appear to be in a language not even remotely resembling
English even though the alphabets used are from the English language. The
The principal will not believe you unless you establish beyond doubt, that the
paper recovered from him contains an answer to one of the questions. You show
the paper to the head of the Computer Science department and he says that it is a
well-known crypto method and agrees to decrypt the same for you. It turns out
that Galois did the following,
He writes the original message in a zig zag pattern and reads of the lines
horizontally. For example, IAMSMARTERTHANYOU is written first as and encoded as IEUATROMRTYSAHNMA

Given the number of rows used by Galois to encode the text and the encoded text, write a program to recover the original text. Note that if the length of the
string is not adequate to complete the pattern, Galois pads it with the character "X" to make up the length. These must not appear in the output.
