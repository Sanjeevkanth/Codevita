Somehow the Relearn's Team saved the day from the Zorbians. Thousands of spaceships were destroyed. The Zorbians got angry but they were still impressed by the creator of the code Dhinesh known as CM. They kidnapped CM, and took him to Zorbia, and locked him in a prison. They kept him there to help them with the technical developments in the technology. He was kept under tight security for a month, during which he helped create many types of equipment. As the day passed by they started believing him and started reducing the security bit by bit.
Even after a year, they kept him locked in the cell.
Meanwhile, on the earth, the government was helpless since they didn't have advanced technology to go in search of him.
Just when CM started losing hope in everything, they asked him to help in repairing a spaceship. It was not in working condition, where there was one other spaceship which was working. But it had a lock, you can either use fingerprint or you will have to unlock it.
The lock is a 3 * 3 cube with 9 numbers on four of its sides {front, bottom, back, top}
The cubes left layer, mid-layer and the right layer can be rotated vertically up. CM somehow finds out the number of rotations, can you help him enter the spaceship?
.......to be continued!
