Sheldon, who has a weird sense of fun suggests a new game to Leonard while they were travelling in the car. Leonard being not so brainy give you the task. The game has the following rules:
1. You will be provided a string of length N.
2. After this you'll be provided with T strings each of length M.
3. You need to find the length of the shortest prefix.
The shortest prefix is nothing but the minimum index of elements in the string of length N that need to be chosen inorder to form the string of length M. For a better understanding of the question look at the sample test case.
Help Leonard!!!
